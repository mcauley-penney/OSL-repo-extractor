### Configuration Options

Following are descriptions of the configuration options that are available as of this version of the program. Please open the [example configuration](./example_io/example_input.json), read it, and have it open as you read the below information. Because the configuration JSON object is treated as a Python dictionary, the entries in the configuration may be in any order. They are given below in the order of the example input.

`⚠️ Warning:` These options are prone to change as the project's needs change.

`🚩 Attention:` To GitHub, all PRs are issues, but not all issues are PRs. When gathering PRs, they are first mined as issues (meaning from the issues endpoints) then checked to see if they are also PRs. This information is relevant to understanding certain options below, such as `state`, and how the possible fields options, such as `issues` and `comments`, work.

#### Other Notes
**You do not need to ask for:**
- issue numbers
- whether an issue is also a PR
- the state of the given PR
- a PR's merged status
- the number of review comments a PR has

These points are required because the project needs them. They will be gathered for every issue you mine without asking.
